# Overview
This project is about using Tkinter and Pygame to create a launcher where the user can login or register in order to play a simple game. I will be working with Firebase to store my user information and I will be using Pygame to create the game. Learn more about creating a pygame on the video under useful websites, the game created on this project, was made with the help of the video. Credits to the author.
